            <h2 class="mb-4">Front-end developer, based in California</h2>
            <p class="mb-3">
              I am from Los Angeles, California, currently working as a physical
              therapy aide at John Geary Inc. Community Center Physical Therapy.
              I have my B.S. degree in Kinesiology with an emphasis in exercise
              science from CSU Northridge. I have worked with people of all ages
              and background in developing fundamental skills, implementing
              exercise for a healthy lifestyle and mindset, and giving
              one-on-one patient care with modalities and exercise for various
              injuries/concerns of the body.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3">
              My journey as a front-end developer started during the pandemic.
              With my workplace closing for majority of the year, I had the time
              and opportunity to learn a new skill for my professional life that
              gives job security, freedom to work from home if needed, and
              pathways for career success. I also loved that this skill can be
              applied to many different feilds of work and allows me to view
              things in a more logical way; it has helped me improve my
              problem-solving skills.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-5">
              I come from a family that has many talented web developers and
              software developers, mostly men. I believe that more women need to
              come into this field too, so that we are able to create products
              that, as a whole, represent the population it serves. That is why
              I am glad I came across SheCodes, their team allows women the
              opportunity to learn how to code through the various workshops
              that they provide. In the future, I will continue learnig
              different languages and aspects of the web developing world and
              hope to help people in a different way than before.
